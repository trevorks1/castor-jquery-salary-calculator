# Jquery-Salary-Calculator

## Description

Duration: 2 Week Sprint

I wanted to create a field of employees, that you could enter into the input fields.
So I created an open var and array to push that employee data into.
Then I wanted to display the employee input data.
So I created a table with rows and columns to store all data in an organized fashion.
Then we add employee annual salary together dividing by 12 to then access the value of monthly total.
To wrap things up, we gave the ability to delete each employee.
Along with their monthly income.
